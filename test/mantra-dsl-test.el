;; Note: we want to retain dynamic binding for these tests because the
;; ERT "fixtures" rely on it.

;; To run the tests from within Emacs, you must `eval-buffer` this test
;; buffer first. Then, run tests using `ert-run-tests-interactively`.
;; But, to avoid having to evaluate the changes (which may affect the live
;; environment), it may be preferable to `make test` at the shell, instead.

;; Notes:
;; - If you see "lisp nesting exceeds max-lisp-eval-depth"
;;   while running these tests, it could be that you have a duplicate
;;   "body" invocation within one of the nested fixtures. Since these
;;   are dynamically bound, every fixture needs to have a distinct
;;   name for the body argument.
;; - If you see errors like "(void-function t)", "(void-function nil)"
;;   and "invalid function nil . 0"
;;   then you probably are using a fixture without wrapping the body
;;   in a lambda

;; Add source paths to load path so the tests can find the source files
